# SC1015-Group-5-Data-Science-Project
# Fake News Classifier
## About
This is a mini-project for SC1015, which focuses on identifying fake news, using the dataset from [Fake News Corpus](https://github.com/several27/FakeNewsCorpus).

Project datasets: rawData.zip and cleanedData.csv

## Contributors
- Nicky - Data cleaning and preprocessing and Neural Network
- Jin Kai - Logistic Regression and EDA
- Meng Kiat - Naive Bayes Classifier, Binary Classification Tree and Ensemble

## Problem Definition
- Are we able to predict whether a news article is fake based on its attributes?
- Which model would be the best to predict?

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Binary Classification Tree
- Ensemble Model
- Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM)

## Conclusion
- Fake news articles tend to have:
  - stronger sentiment 
  - higher usage of first-person pronouns
  - lower usage of third-person pronouns
  - greater number of sentences in news 
- Some words are more prevalent in fake news articles and thus, can be used to determine the credibility of fake news via vectorization
- Combination of a few machine learning models via ensemble can produce a better model

## What did we learn from this project
